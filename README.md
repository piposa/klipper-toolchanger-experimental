# klipper-toolchanger-experimental

Aimed to be **fully compatible** with the original `klipper-toolchanger`.  
Just offering more features, extras, and options to expand upon.  
Basically, the "assortment of Klipper extensions" from viesturz, with the "assortment of Klipper extensions" from me.

## Installation

To install this plugin, run the installation script using the following command over SSH. This script will download this GitHub repository to your RaspberryPi home directory, and symlink the files in the Klipper extra folder.

```commandline
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Contomo/klipper-toolchanger-experimental/main/install.sh | bash
```

## Updates that add new files

Note that if an update has new `klipper/extra` files, they **will not** be automatically installed into Klipper.
You will need to run the intall script manualy to add them:

```commandline
bash ~/klipper-toolchanger/install.sh
```

## Main-Components

* [Toolchanger](docs/toolchanger.md) - tool management support.
* [Tool probe](docs/tool_probe.md) - per tool Z probe.
* [Rounded path](docs/rounded_path.md) - rounds the travel path corners for fast non-print moves.
* [Tools calibrate](docs/tools_calibrate.md) - support for contact based XYZ offset calibration probes.

## Extra-Components

* [Heater power distributor](docs/heater_power_distributor.md) - dynamic heater group power limiting (toolheads for example)
* [Sensorless auto tune](docs/sensorless_auto_tune.md) - automatically determines SGT/SGTHR values for your G28
* [Tool drop detection](docs/tool_drop_detection.md) - continous polling of accelerometers, with peak/angle detection (tool dropped)
* [Heater chamber fan](docs/heater_chamber_fan.md) - like a temperature_fan but it heats. automated chamber filter fan using bed as heater.
