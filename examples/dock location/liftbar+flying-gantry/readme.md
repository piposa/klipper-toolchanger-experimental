# Liftbar

The config in here is an example for a liftbar with a flying gantry (ie, Voron 2.4 with liftbar)  
Do not that currently (15/09/2025) you will need to use an old version of klipper as with the current one the required `manual_rail` is broken.  
a PR of a fix for it is of course very welcome. i myself cant test it as i dont have a liftbar.
