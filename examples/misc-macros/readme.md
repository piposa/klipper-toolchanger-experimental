# misc macros

In here theres just macros which may or may not be related to the toolchanger, and are mostly just "nice to have"


- [Heatsoak](#interruptable_heatsoak)
- [Auto Purge](#AUTO_PURGE)
- [toolchanger shaper management](#TC_SHAPERS)


## interruptable_heatsoak

### Setup required
- rename your old `[gcode_macro PRINT_START]` -> `[gcode_macro _PRINT_START]`
- edit your heatsoak macro/copy your old one in
- make sure you have the duration in the filename, (ie: `{print_time}` in orcas filename format.)

### what it does(nt) do
- does scale based on print duration
- allows you to edit the wait time
- runs your macro at startup, allows you to do other things while the timer is running down
  (so for example, why not calibrate while we wait?)
- popup reopens a minute before it runs out, in case you wanna extend it.

### example heatsoak macro to call
```gcode
[gcode_macro HEATSOAK]
description: "my heatsoak macro"
gcode: ; Will recieve all the same parameters handed into print start to use.
    M140 S{params.BED_TEMP}
    ; move to center
    MOVE_TO_CENTER Z=5
    ; blow hot air
    M106 S255

    ; preheat all the tools
    {% for tn in printer.toolchanger.tool_numbers if 'T' ~ tn ~ '_TEMP' in params %}
        M109 T{tn} S130
    {% endfor %}
```

## AUTO_PURGE
more a sort of toy, but also a purge macro, analyzes your first layer, lays down lines next to the starting position, and purges tools

### setup
- add the folder to your config
- indclude auto_purge/include.cfg
- make sure you got scipy and numpy installed (you do if you have shaketune) (#TODO install dependencies)
- edit the path to point to the folder you added (`'lib_path':'~/printer_data/config/toolchanger/auto_purge'`)
- add AUTO_PURGE {rawparams} to your print start where you want to purge

### what it does

Spawns a preview SVG to console, purges your tools

### settings
theres various settings in auto_purge.cfg right at the top to adjust, such as prime line width etc, tool nozzle size yada yada is inferred from the respective extruder configs.

## TC_SHAPERS

![image](../../media/shaper_calibration_example.png)

All the needed knobs are right at the top of the file, nothing is however preventing you from changing anything else in here.
Macro descriptions should be pretty self explanatory.
- change show_images to False if you experience any issues
- change async to 0 to wait for the command to finish (~2 minutes)
- leave async 1 and the images will be rendered in the background and will become avalible in console/wherever they are saved once done.

before you run this you should probably edit your `save_path` of `SHOW_LATEST_SHAPER_PLOT` and perhaps configure `save_variables` if not already setup.

To load the shapers automatically youd add `TC_LOAD_SHAPERS` into the after change of your toolchanger.
